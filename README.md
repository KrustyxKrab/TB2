### Overview

The Tech Basics 2 Project is a Python-based application designed to [provide a brief description of the project’s purpose and functionality]. This project utilizes the Streamlit framework for creating an interactive web interface.

### Features
	•	Interactive Web Interface: Built with Streamlit to provide a user-friendly experience.
	•	Modular Code Structure: Organized into distinct modules for ease of maintenance and scalability.
	•	Configuration Management: Centralized configuration settings for streamlined application management.

### Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:
	1.	Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/KrustyxKrab/TB2.git
cd TB2


	2.	Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`


	3.	Install Dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt



### Usage

To run the application:

streamlit run BuildApp.py

This command will launch the Streamlit app in your default web browser.
