   For me, the founder of Locato, the protection of your data is a very high priority. Due to the early stage of this app, we don't have the best security features, yet all our code is open source and you can see what happens to your data.
    I am also very transparent with your data on the front end. Under **Your Account** you can delete the tags that are used to suggest locations to you or recustomize your account settings
